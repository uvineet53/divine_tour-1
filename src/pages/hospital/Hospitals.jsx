            We believe in the ancient Indian philosophy of promoting health and
            happiness for all. As a medical travel technology company, we offer
            patient-friendly accommodation near top hospitals in India. Complex
            medical treatments like cancer, cardiology, advanced dental,
            fertility, orthopedic, or cosmetic surgeries often require expertise
            and facilities not available locally. India has become a global hub
            for medical tourism, with cities like Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai,
            Bangalore, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Vellore boasting world-class
            hospitals and leading medical specialists. Our AI-enabled services
            cater to patients' needs, providing budget-friendly accommodations,
            transport, food, medicines, medical equipment, and trained
            attendants. We aim to make your medical stay as comfortable and
            peaceful as possible, so you can focus on your health and loved
            ones.

            stay – before, during and even after the treatment i.e. recovery and
            follow-up stage.

          <p>
            Upon special request made at the time of booking a room, we will
            definitely strive to arrange for vehicles in special cases for
            patients having an illness or disability that makes it impractical
            to use any other form of transport; for example, severe immobility
            or disorientation.

            Home Medical Devices come in various shapes, sizes and weights. You
            may need extra space, money, effort and in some cases even legal
            clearance for air travel. So, carrying them along may not be a good
            idea for medical travelers. Although some airlines do allow patients
            to carry their medical equipment and mobility aids, it is always
            cumbersome for the traveller to carry it to distant locations. Be it
            a battery-powered wheelchair or mobility aid or apnoea monitors or
            exterior medical devices or an oxygen cylinder. we make sure your
            requirement of medical equipment is taken care of during your
            medical trip.
          </p>
          <p>
            With us, you don’t need to carry your heavy, odd-sized medical
            equipment during your medical travel. We have tied up with ‘Medical
            Equipment Partners’ who – upon special request placed at the time of
            booking – can help provide the required Home Medical equipment as
            per your specific requirements or doctor’s instructions at nominal
            charges.
